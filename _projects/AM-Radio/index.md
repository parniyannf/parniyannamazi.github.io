This project involved designing and building a complete AM radio receiver on a breadboard. The circuit includes an LC tuning stage, a diode-based envelope detector, and an op-amp audio amplifier to receive and demodulate broadcast AM signals.

The receiver was tested across the 550–1600 kHz AM band using an oscilloscope and headphones. Component values were adjusted to improve tuning selectivity, reduce detector ripple, and achieve clearer audio output. The project emphasized hands-on circuit analysis, signal behavior, and iterative debugging.
