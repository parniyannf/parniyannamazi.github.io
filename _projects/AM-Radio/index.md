This project involved designing and building a complete AM radio receiver on a breadboard. The circuit includes an LC tuning stage, a diode-based envelope detector, and an op-amp audio amplifier to receive and demodulate broadcast AM signals.

The receiver was tested across the 550–1600 kHz AM band using an oscilloscope and headphones. Component values were adjusted to improve tuning selectivity, reduce detector ripple, and achieve clearer audio output. The project emphasized hands-on circuit analysis, signal behavior, and iterative debugging.

## Circuit Overview

The receiver consists of three main stages: a tunable LC front end for station selection, a diode-based envelope detector for demodulation, and an op-amp audio amplifier for driving headphones or a speaker.

## Testing and Results

Signal behavior was observed using an oscilloscope at key nodes in the circuit. Tuning performance, audio clarity, and noise levels were improved through iterative component selection and physical layout adjustments on the breadboard.
